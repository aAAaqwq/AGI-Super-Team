<h1 align="center">AGI Super Team</h1>

<p align="center"><strong>An organized, installable team of Agents + Skills for local AI agent frameworks.</strong></p>

<p align="center">
  Start with an outcome. Let the CEO route executives, executives dispatch specialists, Skills supply methods, and the Governor verify the result.
</p>

AGI Super Team is not a Codex-only plugin. It is a versioned, organized **Agents + Skills team system** for Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, and other mainstream local AI agent frameworks through 19 explicit adapters.

The same organizational contract travels across frameworks: 14 top-level roles, 92 opt-in specialists, reusable Skills, eight outcome Teams, independent review, and explicit human approval.

Each adapter maps that contract to the capabilities its target actually supports.

## See what your team actually does

Ask for a landing page. Get a scoped brief, working files, and a review you can inspect. This is an illustrative workflow, not a claim of a completed run.

![Example workflow: CEO and CPO scope a landing page; PE and specialists build it; Governor reviews; you decide the next step.](./docs/assets/team-workflow.svg)

| Your goal | Work to expect | Team |
|---|---|---|
| Build a product | Product brief → implementation → review | [product-delivery](./starter-kits/product-delivery/) |
| Create a content series | Source notes → channel-ready drafts → claims review | [content-creator](./starter-kits/content-creator/) |
| Research a decision | Question → evidence map → decision memo | [research-decision](./starter-kits/research-decision/) |

**Version note:** No version number is written here on purpose — a hardcoded one goes stale at the next release. `@latest` installs whatever npm currently publishes, which may differ from this checkout. Resolve both yourself instead of trusting prose:

```bash
npm view agi-super-team version               # the version `@latest` resolves to
node -p "require('./package.json').version"   # this source tree
```

Dist-tags other than `latest` are not guaranteed to point at a current release. For one dated example of a source/registry divergence and its recovery, see the [1.5.0 release diagnosis](./docs/guides/npm-release-status.md).

## ⚡ Quick Start for Coding Agents

Paste this entire prompt into Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, or another coding agent. It authorizes installation only after a clean preview.

```text
Install AGI Super Team from https://github.com/aAAaqwq/AGI-Super-Team into this coding-agent environment.

1. Detect the current client and run `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --list-tools`.
2. Choose exactly one matching adapter. Never use `--all-tools` for this installation.
3. If this client supports native subagents, include `--all-subagents`; otherwise omit it and state the limitation.
4. Run the selected command without `--install` first. Show the resolved package version, destinations, managed files, and conflicts.
5. If the target is unambiguous and the preview is clean, run the same selection with `--install --connect`, then run a separate `--doctor` check.
6. Stop instead of overwriting unmanaged files, using credentials, or guessing when the framework or destination is unclear.
7. Report what was installed, whether native delegation is available, and whether I must restart or open a new task.
```

This is one-prompt installation, not blind installation. Ambiguity, unsafe destinations, or conflicts still stop the workflow.

## 🐝 Run your first swarm

After installation, restart the client or open a new task. Start with this reusable prompt:

```text
Swarm agents: <your outcome>

Act as the CEO coordinator.
- Define the outcome and acceptance checks.
- Choose the smallest sufficient team.
- Parallelize only independent work with explicit file ownership.
- Use Skills as methods and require an independent Governor review.
- Synthesize one verified result.

If native multi-agent delegation is unavailable, execute the same role plan sequentially and say so. Do not publish, deploy, spend money, use credentials, or take irreversible action without my approval.
```

`Swarm agents:` is the routing cue, not a promise of unlimited parallelism. The installed framework controls actual concurrency, nesting, tools, and model access.

<a id="install-into-your-agent-framework"></a>
## 🛠️ Manual CLI installation

List all 19 adapter targets, preview one target, then apply the same selection:

```bash
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --list-tools
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool claude-code
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool claude-code --install --connect
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool claude-code --doctor
```

The commands above use the public npm package. For reproducible automation, do not leave `@latest` in a pinned pipeline — resolve an exact published version first and pin that, so a later release cannot change what your run installs:

```bash
AGI_VERSION="$(npm view agi-super-team version)"
npx -y "agi-super-team@${AGI_VERSION}" --tool claude-code --install --connect
```

The npm distribution keeps its `SKILL.md` entrypoints discoverable and includes the complete files for every Skill assigned by `config/team-manifest.json`. Browse the provenance-backed [Daniel's Original Skills](./skills/original/) collection for reviewed first-party work. Clone the repository when you need every auxiliary asset from the wider Skill library.

Replace `claude-code` with an ID from `--list-tools`. Use `--all-tools` only when you intentionally want every global and project adapter. A no-argument run remains the legacy Codex preview; new automation should always name `--tool` or `--all-tools`.

### Pick your framework

Every command below has the same shape. Substitute the `--tool` ID for whichever client you already use — no framework is a prerequisite for another:

```bash
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id>                  # preview, writes nothing
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id> --install        # apply
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id> --install --connect
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id> --doctor         # verify what landed
```

Five frameworks carry the full harness Adapter contract, including native Agent generation and a connection receipt:

| Platform | `--tool` | Preview command | Installed capability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `claude-code` | `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool claude-code` | Native Markdown Agents + canonical Skills + Claude orchestrator |
| Codex | `codex` | `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool codex` | Main-session CEO + native TOML Agents + canonical Skills |
| OpenClaw | `openclaw` | `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool openclaw` | Namespaced Agent workspaces + canonical Skills + safe config merge |
| Hermes Agent | `hermes` | `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool hermes` | Role Skills + canonical Skills + Profiles/Kanban blueprints |
| DeepSeek Harness | `dsh` | `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool dsh` | Declarative cordis patch enabling the Skill root + AGENTS.md CEO block + preset |

The other fourteen targets use the generic installer — same commands, same preview-first safety, without the external Adapter module. See [all 19 targets](#all-19-adapter-targets).

`--install` materializes files; `--install --connect` also writes a connection receipt. OpenClaw dry-runs and then upserts managed `agents.list` entries while preserving unmanaged Agents and creating no channel bindings. Claude and Codex use filesystem discovery. Hermes emits blueprints but does not create Profiles, Cron jobs, or a Gateway. See the [primary harness Adapter guide](./docs/guides/harness-adapters.md) for paths, permissions, and receipt requirements.

OpenClaw `2026.7.1-2` requires Node.js `>=22.22.3 <23`, `>=24.15.0 <25`, or `>=25.9.0`. AGI Super Team itself still supports Node.js 18+, so this stricter prerequisite applies only when invoking the current OpenClaw CLI.

Claude Code, Codex, OpenClaw, Hermes, and DeepSeek Harness are first-class entry points to the same team system, not separate editions with different organizations.

Delivery format varies because each framework exposes different native Agent and Skill primitives.

### Install executive subagent groups

The default remains the 14 top-level roles. Add one executive pyramid, or all 92 optional specialists — these flags work identically for every `--tool`:

```bash
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id> --with-subagents cto
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id> --with-subagents cfo --with-subagents clo
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool <id> --all-subagents --install
```

The hierarchy is CEO → eleven manager executives → leaf specialists. CTO also references the existing canonical PE as delivery lead; it does not create a second PE identity. All 92 source files under `agents/*/subagents/*/AGENTS.md` are byte-for-byte copies from pinned `jnMetaCode/agency-agents-zh`; local routing and safety envelopes remain separate. CEO retains coordination authority, Governor remains an independent reviewer, and PE remains CTO's canonical delivery leaf rather than another manager. See [`config/agent-sources.lock.json`](./config/agent-sources.lock.json) for source URLs and SHA-256 digests. Nested Codex routing requires `max_depth = 2`; with four threads, run one manager plus at most two children per wave.

These are **19 AI client/runtime adapter targets**, not 19 interchangeable CLIs. An adapter can install native Agents, native Skills, project rules/context, or role packs degraded to Agent-as-Skill. File placement does not by itself prove that a current client loaded or executed the content.

### All 19 adapter targets

Global adapters normally resolve from the selected OS-home base; project adapters resolve from the selected project directory. OpenClaw and Hermes instead honor their native runtime roots, as shown below.

| ID | Client/runtime | Scope | Agent delivery | Skill delivery | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `claude-code` | Claude Code | Global | Native Markdown Agent: `.claude/agents` | Canonical: `.claude/skills` | Structurally connected; runtime pending |
| `codex` | Codex | Global | Main-session CEO + TOML: `.codex/agents` | Canonical: `.agents/skills` | Structurally connected; runtime pending |
| `openclaw` | OpenClaw | Global | Native workspace: `<active config dir>/agency-agents/agi-super-team` | Canonical: `<active config dir>/skills/agi-super-team` | Structurally connected; runtime pending |
| `hermes` | Hermes Agent | Global | Role Skills: `$HERMES_HOME/skills/agi-super-team-agents` | Canonical: `$HERMES_HOME/skills/agi-super-team` | Blueprint connected; runtime pending |
| `dsh` | DeepSeek Harness | Global | Preset: `.dsh/.agent-presets/ast-team` | Canonical: `.dsh/skills/agi-super-team` | Structurally connected; runtime pending |
| `copilot` | GitHub Copilot | Global | Markdown Agent: `.github/agents`, `.copilot/agents` | Native: `.copilot/skills` | Adapter |
| `antigravity` | Antigravity | Global | Agent: `.gemini/config/agents` | Native: `.gemini/config/skills` | **Experimental** |
| `gemini-cli` | Gemini CLI | Global | Markdown Agent: `.gemini/agents` | Native: `.gemini/skills` | Adapter |
| `opencode` | OpenCode | Global | Markdown Agent: `.config/opencode/agents` | Native: `.config/opencode/skills` | Adapter |
| `cursor` | Cursor | Global | Markdown Agent: `.cursor/agents` | Native: `.cursor/skills` | **Experimental** |
| `trae` | Trae | Project | Project rule: `.trae/rules` | Native: `.trae/skills` | Project adapter |
| `aider` | Aider | Project | Combined project rules: `CONVENTIONS.md` | Combined into the same project context | Project adapter |
| `windsurf` | Windsurf | Project | Combined project rules: `.windsurfrules` | Combined into the same project context | Project adapter |
| `qwen` | Qwen Code | Global | Markdown Agent: `.qwen/agents` | Native: `.qwen/skills` | Adapter |
| `deerflow` | DeerFlow | Project | Agent-as-Skill: `skills/custom/agi-super-team-agents` | Native: `skills/custom/agi-super-team` | Project adapter |
| `workbuddy` | WorkBuddy | Global | Agent-as-Skill: `.workbuddy/skills/agi-super-team-agents` | Native: `.workbuddy/skills/agi-super-team` | Adapter |
| `codewhale` | CodeWhale | Global | Agent-as-Skill: `.codewhale/skills/agi-super-team-agents` | Native: `.codewhale/skills/agi-super-team` | Adapter |
| `kiro` | Kiro | Global | Markdown Agent: `.kiro/agents` | Native: `.kiro/skills` | Adapter |
| `qoder` | Qoder | Global | Markdown Agent: `.qoder/agents` | Native: `.qoder/skills` | Adapter |

The matrix describes the adapter contract in [`config/cli-adapters.json`](./config/cli-adapters.json), not a claim that all 19 clients have been runtime-verified. Cursor and Antigravity are explicitly experimental.

### Ecosystem plugins

Beyond file placement, some clients also support installing this repository as a native plugin through their own marketplace. The repository carries the manifests for these:

| Client | Mechanism | Manifest | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Codex | `codex plugin marketplace add aAAaqwq/AGI-Super-Team` | [`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`](./.agents/plugins/marketplace.json) | Verified end-to-end |
| Claude Code | marketplace at [`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`](./.claude-plugin/marketplace.json) | `claude plugin validate .` | Manifest validates clean |
| Kimi | `plugin.json` at `.kimi-plugin/` or `kimi.plugin.json` | [`.kimi-plugin/plugin.json`](./.kimi-plugin/plugin.json) | Manifest valid, but only as an install source — plugins are user-scoped and run from a managed copy |
| Cursor | `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` | [`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json`](./.cursor-plugin/plugin.json) | Manifest fields corrected to the official schema (`skills`); client load not yet verified |
| Gemini CLI | `gemini extensions install <repo>` | [`gemini-extension.json`](./gemini-extension.json) | Manifest valid; mechanism documented, end-to-end unverified |
| DeepSeek Harness | `npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool dsh --install` | — | Adapter present; runtime evidence `pending` |

Skills interoperate because `SKILL.md` follows the [agentskills.io](https://agentskills.io) open standard, which these clients share. The `~/.agents/skills/` root in particular is read by more than one client, so a single install can serve several.

Which mechanisms each client actually honors is documented in [Coding agent assembly](./docs/researchs/coding-agent-assembly.md), including which claims are verified and which are not.

Use the canonical [`orchestrate-agi-super-team`](./skills/orchestrate-agi-super-team/SKILL.md) Skill when a task needs the complete Team → C-suite → Skills/Subagents → Governor → CEO → human-approval flow. It detects the current framework's real delegation limits and records any flat or sequential fallback instead of pretending native nesting occurred.

### Select destinations, refresh, and verify

Use `--home` to redirect the OS-home base and `--project-dir` for project-scoped targets (the project directory defaults to the current directory). Hermes gives a non-empty `HERMES_HOME` precedence; OpenClaw follows `OPENCLAW_HOME`, `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`, and `OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`. Combining `--home` with a conflicting runtime override fails before any write. This makes a disposable audit easy:

```bash
AGI_AUDIT_HOME="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agi-super-team-home.XXXXXX")"
AGI_AUDIT_PROJECT="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agi-super-team-project.XXXXXX")"

npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool openclaw \
  --home "$AGI_AUDIT_HOME" --project-dir "$AGI_AUDIT_PROJECT"
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool openclaw \
  --home "$AGI_AUDIT_HOME" --project-dir "$AGI_AUDIT_PROJECT" --install
npx -y agi-super-team@latest --tool openclaw \
  --home "$AGI_AUDIT_HOME" --project-dir "$AGI_AUDIT_PROJECT" --doctor
```

Run the same `--install` command again to refresh managed content; use `--install --connect` when the connection and pending receipt should also be refreshed, then repeat `--doctor`. Restart or open a new task in the target client and verify that it discovers the expected Agent/Skill surface. `--doctor` verifies installed adapter artifacts, not model behavior or task quality.

### Safety and update limits

- Preview is the default and performs no writes; `--install` is the explicit write boundary.
- Reapplying the same selection is designed to be idempotent. Differing managed destinations are backed up before replacement; unrelated client files are outside the managed selection.
- Backups are local recovery aids, not a complete snapshot or uninstall system. Review the preview and keep your own version-control or filesystem backup for important configuration.
- Symlinked or unsafe destinations are refused. `--no-agents` and `--no-skills` can narrow the payload when needed.
- This project does not use a remote-script pipe installer; the commands above use npm's package runner and still deserve normal dependency review.
- Installation proves file materialization only. Runtime evidence for all four primary Adapters remains `pending` until a clean-client canary is bound to a clean source revision.

The adapter design was inspired in part by [`jnMetaCode/agency-agents-zh`](https://github.com/jnMetaCode/agency-agents-zh) at fixed commit [`2ecfabf8`](https://github.com/jnMetaCode/agency-agents-zh/commit/2ecfabf8e944ccdfed63ad8c44d5241290af6977). AGI Super Team's manifest, payload mapping, safety behavior, and evidence boundaries are maintained here.

## 🧠 The system in one minute

| Layer | What you get | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **🧩 Skills** | Canonical physical `SKILL.md` files grouped into 14 outcome categories | Reuse focused playbooks instead of rebuilding instructions for every task |
| **🤖 Agents** | 14 top-level role packs plus 92 optional direct specialists with exact routing and source locks | Give planning, engineering, product, content, research, and review clear ownership |
| **🔁 Team packs** | 8 manifest-driven outcome Teams, from Solo Founder to Full Team | Start with the smallest team that can own the outcome instead of loading everything |

<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/aAAaqwq/AGI-Super-Team/actions/workflows/validate-repository.yml"><img src="https://github.com/aAAaqwq/AGI-Super-Team/actions/workflows/validate-repository.yml/badge.svg" alt="Repository contracts"></a>

</p>

Team, C-suite, Subagents, and Skills form an outcome-driven graph rather than a directory inheritance chain. A Team selects the smallest sufficient C-suite; each executive receives assigned Skills on one branch and an allowlisted specialist roster on another; all evidence flows through an independent Governor gate.

```mermaid

  CEO --> H["Human approval<br/>release, money, credentials, irreversible actions"]
```

Skills and Subagents are parallel capability branches beneath a C-suite role, not an automatic `Subagent → Skill` inheritance chain. See [How Teams, C-suite Agents, Subagents, and Skills connect](./docs/guides/team-agent-skill-architecture.md) for the contract compiler, runtime sequence, framework mappings, and invariants.

AGI Super Team owns the versioned content, selection rules, safe copying, and repository checks. Your configured coding-agent harness owns the model, credentials, tools, execution, and final task output.

## 🎯 Start with an outcome

Choose the army that matches the outcome. Each Team has a CEO coordinator, a bounded executive core, an independent Governor gate, and access to additional executives or specialists when a named evidence gap requires them.

| Team army | Give it | Intended evaluation outputs | Core team |
|---|---|---|---|
| [🚀 Solo Founder](./starter-kits/solo-founder/) | A bounded product idea or launch brief | Product decision, test-first plan, launch evidence, Governor decision | CEO, CPO, PE, Governor |
| [✍️ Content Creator](./starter-kits/content-creator/) | Approved sources, audience, and channel | Evidence brief, channel-ready drafts, measurement plan, claims review | CEO, CRO, CCO, CMO, Governor |
| [📊 Quant Research](./starter-kits/quant-trader/) | A hypothesis and historical data | Reproducible backtest specification, risk memo, independent gate | CEO, CQO, CDO, CFO, Governor |
| [🧱 Product Delivery](./starter-kits/product-delivery/) | A validated user problem and delivery constraints | Product brief, architecture decision, tested change, release handoff | CEO, CPO, CTO, PE, Governor |
| [🔬 Research Decision](./starter-kits/research-decision/) | A consequential question and decision criteria | Research plan, evidence map, cited synthesis, decision memo | CEO, CRO, CDO, Governor |
| [📣 Go To Market](./starter-kits/go-to-market/) | Validated positioning and a launch/revenue objective | Positioning brief, launch assets, revenue experiment, risk gate | CEO, CPO, CMO, CCO, CSO, Governor |
| [🚨 Operations Response](./starter-kits/operations-response/) | A bounded incident or delivery failure | Incident scope, containment, verified recovery, post-incident review | CEO, COO, CTO, PE, Governor |
| [🏛️ Executive Team](./starter-kits/full-team/) | A cross-functional company brief | Executive routing plan, specialist artifacts, independent review, verified handoff | All 14 top-level roles available; CEO coordinates, Governor reviews |

Start with the smallest complete army that can own the outcome. `full-team` makes all 14 top-level roles eligible, but the CEO still dispatches only the roles and specialists justified by the brief.

## ⚡ Legacy generic workspace materializer

The multi-client npm installer above is the primary entry point. The older `install.sh` path remains useful when you want harness-neutral, inspectable role workspaces instead of a client adapter. Clone `main` and preview Solo Founder; preview is the default and writes nothing:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch main https://github.com/aAAaqwq/AGI-Super-Team.git
cd AGI-Super-Team
git rev-parse HEAD
./install.sh --source "$PWD" --destination /path/to/review-workspace solo-founder
```

Inspect the selected Agents and destinations. Apply only when they match your intent:

```bash
./install.sh --source "$PWD" --destination /path/to/review-workspace --apply solo-founder
```

The generic installer validates every required file before publishing staged workspaces. It preserves existing persona and skill files and rejects dangerous source or destination symlinks. See [setup.md](./setup.md) for prerequisites, updates, and recovery.

The manifest separates portable `required`/`optional` Skills from `harnessSpecific` catalog entries and unbundled external recommendations. Generic installs copy only classes that pass the current portability contract; the complete copied payload is scanned for known host paths and runtime-only commands.

**Success:** the preview writes nothing; apply creates three inspectable role workspaces without overwriting existing files.

## ✨ Browse Skills by provenance

Choose a trust boundary before browsing by topic. Provenance labels describe reviewed origin evidence; they do not claim runtime verification.

### 🔎 Find high-quality skill sources

[`agent-skill-repository-index`](./skills/agent-skill-repository-index/) turns Daniel's reviewed source list into a safe selection workflow. Compare one candidate, inspect its permissions and provenance, then install or remove it without globally activating entire repositories.

| Need | Maintained reference |
|---|---|
| Compare reviewed sources | [Source matrix](./skills/agent-skill-repository-index/references/repositories.md) |
| Inspect the dated popularity signal | [Star snapshot](./skills/agent-skill-repository-index/references/star-snapshot.md) |
| Install one candidate safely | [Installation workflow](./skills/agent-skill-repository-index/references/installing.md) |

Stars help with discovery, not trust. The matrix records `DAILY`, `LIBRARY`, and `QUARANTINE` boundaries; catalogs and runtimes are never bulk-installed.

## ✅ What is useful today

You can already browse a deterministic skill catalog, inspect every Agent instruction, preview a manifest-selected team, and assemble local role workspaces without overwriting existing files.

## 🧾 Reproducible installation receipt

Create a disposable destination, prove preview wrote nothing, apply, and verify the three expected Solo Founder workspaces:

```bash
AGI_SOLO_DEST="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agi-solo-founder.XXXXXX")"

./install.sh --source "$PWD" --destination "$AGI_SOLO_DEST" solo-founder
test -z "$(find "$AGI_SOLO_DEST" -mindepth 1 -print -quit)"

./install.sh --source "$PWD" --destination "$AGI_SOLO_DEST" --apply solo-founder
test -f "$AGI_SOLO_DEST/workspace-ceo/SOUL.md"
test -f "$AGI_SOLO_DEST/workspace-pe/SOUL.md"
test -f "$AGI_SOLO_DEST/workspace-cco/SOUL.md"

python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt
npm test
npm run validate -- --warnings-as-errors
npm run check:skills
npm run check:taxonomy-evaluation
npm run check:architecture
```

This receipt proves manifest-driven selection, preview safety, staged copying, and repository integrity for the inspected checkout and destination state. It does not prove harness loading, task quality, or business outcomes.

## 🔌 Choose a distribution

Use the [one-prompt Coding Agent installer](#coding-agent-quick-start) or the manual 19-target npm installer above for a named Agent framework.

Use the [curated Codex package](./.codex/INDEX.md) for Codex-specific details, or the legacy generic workspace materializer for harness-neutral files.

The [Claude Code guide](./docs/guides/claude-code-install.html) and [Harness compatibility guide](./docs/guides/harness-compatibility.html) provide background. Current Adapter manifests and commit-matched receipts govern support claims.

The generic path requires Bash and Node.js; repository verification also requires npm and Python 3. Exact operating-system and client-version support remains bounded by CI and published receipts. Adapter presence never establishes feature parity.

| File or directory | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [`config/team-manifest.json`](./config/team-manifest.json) | Source of truth for Agents, kits, and portable, harness-specific, or external Skill assignments |
| [`config/repository-architecture.json`](./config/repository-architecture.json) | Machine-readable Modules, path owners, generated lineage, and Adapter status |
| [`agents/`](./agents/) and [`skills/`](./skills/) | Authored, versioned inputs; only manifest-classified portable payloads enter generic workspaces |
| [`docs/guides/team-agent-skill-architecture.md`](./docs/guides/team-agent-skill-architecture.md) | Team, C-suite, Subagent, Skill, Governor, and human-approval linking principles |
| [`.codex/INDEX.md`](./.codex/INDEX.md) | Installation guide and Codex package index |
| [`plugins/agi-super-team-codex/`](./plugins/agi-super-team-codex/) | Actual curated Codex plugin, skills, and bundled agent roles |
| [`install.sh`](./install.sh) | Preview-first selection, preflight, staging, and no-clobber publishing |
| [`scripts/repository_model.py`](./scripts/repository_model.py) | Shared inventory and manifest model used by validation and generation |
| [`catalog/`](./catalog/) | Generated discovery output; never an inventory source |
| [`tests/`](./tests/) | Repository, installer, site-data, and SEO contracts |
| [`docs/`](./docs/) | Project site, verification data, and editorial guides |

For the authored-input, generated-output, distribution, and evidence boundaries, read the full [repository architecture map](./ARCHITECTURE.md), [shared language](./CONTEXT.md), and [decision records](./docs/adr/).

[`config/external-skill-sources.json`](./config/external-skill-sources.json) records tombstones for removed machine-local links, including unresolved provenance fields. README text and generated catalog files are not inventory sources.

## 🧠 Team topology

```text
Founder / operator
└── CEO: coordination and quality gates
    ├── CTO / PE: architecture and implementation
    ├── CPO / CCO / CMO: product, content, and growth
    ├── CQO / CFO / CDO: quantitative research, finance, and data
    ├── CLO / CRO / CSO / COO: legal, research, sales, and operations
    └── Governor: independent review and escalation
```

Mentor names are creative framing. They do not imply affiliation, endorsement, or guaranteed imitation.

## 🛡️ Boundaries and human approval

AGI Super Team is not a model, autonomous orchestrator, or agent runtime. Installing files does not make a harness load or execute them automatically.

- Inspect third-party commands and dependencies before execution.
- Never place credentials, private data, browser sessions, or production configuration in a skill or issue.
- Keep financial workflows in research or paper-trading environments until independently validated.
- Require explicit human approval for posts, messages, transactions, deployments, and destructive operations.
- Report vulnerabilities privately through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/aAAaqwq/AGI-Super-Team/security/advisories/new).

Eight datasets in this repository — the skill catalog, agent indexes, harness packages, quality and taxonomy reports among them — are generated from `skills/` and `config/` and committed alongside them. Enable the pre-commit hook once per clone so that editing either directory regenerates them instead of letting them drift:

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

The hook regenerates that derived data on commits touching `skills/` or `config/`, stages what it rewrote, and blocks the commit when a generator fails or when the change pushes a metric past the quality-baseline ratchet. It is not enabled by default — `core.hooksPath` is per-clone state — so run the command above after cloning. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for both guards and the manual fallback.
